## General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is ContentStats.io?">
    ContentStats.io is a social media analytics API that tracks video performance across TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter. We provide hourly snapshots, bot detection, and historical data through a simple REST API.
    
    Unlike official platform APIs, we don't require approval, business accounts, or complex OAuth flows.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How is this different from official APIs?">
    **Official APIs (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube):**
    - Require approval (weeks/months wait)
    - Complex OAuth implementation
    - Limited to your own content
    - Daily quotas and strict rate limits
    
    **ContentStats.io:**
    - ✅ Instant access with API key
    - ✅ Track ANY public video
    - ✅ No quotas or approval process
    - ✅ Built-in bot detection
    - ✅ Hourly automated tracking
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is this legal?">
    **Yes.** We only access publicly available data through legitimate means. We don't:
    - Violate platform Terms of Service
    - Access private or restricted content
    - Use harmful scraping techniques
    - Store personal user data
    
    We're similar to analytics tools like Social Blade or HypeAuditor.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What platforms do you support?">
    We currently support:
    - **TikTok**: Views, likes, comments, shares, saves
    - **YouTube**: Views, likes, comments
    - **Instagram**: Likes, comments, saves
    - **Twitter/X**: Views, likes, retweets, replies
    
    All platforms include AI-powered bot detection.
  </Accordion>

## Pricing & Billing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How much does it cost?">
    **Simple pay-per-use pricing:**
    - $0.015 per snapshot
    - No subscriptions or monthly fees
    - $5 free credit for new accounts (~333 snapshots)
    
    **Example:** Track a video for 7 days
    ```
    7 days × 24 hours = 168 snapshots
    168 × $0.015 = $2.52
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How does billing work?">
    - Charged per snapshot collected
    - Snapshots collected hourly
    - Deducted from your account balance
    - Add credits anytime (minimum $10)
    - Optional auto top-up available
    
    **Example:** If you track 10 videos for 7 days each:
    ```
    10 videos × 168 snapshots = 1,680 snapshots
    1,680 × $0.015 = $25.20 total
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if I run out of credits?">
    When balance reaches $0:
    - Active tracking automatically pauses
    - All collected data is preserved
    - Add credits to resume tracking
    - Tracking continues from where it left off
    
    Set up auto top-up to never run out!

## Bot Detection

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does bot detection work?">
    Our AI analyzes multiple signals to detect fake engagement:
    
    1. **Engagement Velocity**: Unusual spike patterns
    2. **Comment Quality**: Generic/spammy comments
    3. **Timing Patterns**: 24/7 engagement without dips
    4. **Ratio Analysis**: Suspicious metrics ratios
    5. **Channel Context**: Account age and history
    
    **Bot confidence score:**
    - 0.0 - 0.3 = Authentic
    - 0.3 - 0.5 = Suspicious
    - 0.5 - 0.7 = Likely botted
    - 0.7 - 1.0 = Definitely botted
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How accurate is bot detection?">
    Our AI model achieves **87% accuracy** in detecting bot-driven engagement, trained on millions of videos across all platforms.
    
    We continuously improve the model with new patterns and user feedback.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I see why engagement was flagged?">
    Yes! Each video includes detailed `bot_analysis` with:
    - Individual score for each detection method
    - Specific patterns identified
    - Flags with severity levels (low/medium/high)
    - Evidence supporting the detection
    
    Example:
    ```json
    {
      "flags": [
        {
          "type": "engagement_spike",
          "severity": "high",
          "description": "Unusual like velocity detected",
          "evidence": { "spike_at": "2024-01-29T15:00:00Z" }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I track my competitors?">
    **Yes!** Track any public video from any account. Common uses:
    - Monitor competitor content performance
    - Analyze their engagement patterns
    - Track their posting frequency
    - Identify their top-performing content
    
    This is impossible with official APIs (they only allow tracking your own content).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I verify influencer engagement?">
    **Yes!** Perfect for influencer vetting:
    - Track their recent posts for 3-7 days
    - Check bot confidence scores
    - Analyze engagement patterns
    - Verify authentic vs. fake engagement
    
    Our bot detection helps avoid partnerships with fake influencers.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I track trending videos?">
    **Yes!** Track any public trending video:
    - Identify what goes viral in your niche
    - Analyze viral patterns
    - Research content strategies
    - Monitor hashtag performance
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I track my own content?">
    **Absolutely!** Track your own videos to:
    - Monitor performance in real-time
    - Get hourly growth data
    - Detect bot activity on your content
    - Build historical performance database
    
    Much more powerful than native platform analytics.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why is tracking not starting?">
    Common causes:
    - **Insufficient balance**: Add credits
    - **Invalid video URL**: Check URL format
    - **Private video**: Only public videos work
    - **Video deleted**: Cannot track deleted content
    
    Check the error message in API response for details.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why aren't snapshots appearing?">
    - **First snapshot takes up to 1 hour**
    - Platform delays (YouTube especially)
    - Video was deleted
    - Platform temporarily unavailable
    
    Wait 60 minutes after starting tracking.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why did tracking stop?">
    Tracking auto-stops when:
    - Balance reaches $0 (pauses until you add credits)
    - Duration completed
    - Video was deleted
    - You manually stopped it
    
    Check video status in dashboard or via API.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why are view counts not updating?">
    Platforms cache view counts:
    - **YouTube**: Can cache for hours
    - **TikTok**: Usually real-time
    - **Instagram**: Updates frequently
    
    This is platform behavior, not our limitation.
